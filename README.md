# **Stylo 2.0: Fashion Feature Extraction and Ontology Management System**

## **Overview**  
**Stylo 2.0** is a comprehensive solution for extracting and managing fashion-related features from multi-modal data sources. The system employs advanced AI models to extract features from images and textual data, mapping them to an ontology framework. It allows for scalable processing of large datasets and provides a dynamic and extensible structure to handle evolving fashion trends.

## **Key Features**  
- **Multi-modal Data Integration:** Extracts features from both textual (CSV) and visual (image) data.
- **Ontology Framework:** Dynamically manages and organizes extracted features into a hierarchical structure.
- **High-Performance Processing:** Efficient pipelines with GPU acceleration and asynchronous processing.
- **Web Interface:** Interactive website for uploading datasets, visualizing extracted features, and managing the ontology.
- **Scalable Architecture:** Designed to handle large datasets with scalability in mind.

## **Technologies Used**  
- **Frontend:** React.js, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** FastAPI, WebSocket
- **Image Processing:** YOLOv5, ResNet50
- **Text Processing:** BERT, spaCy
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Cloud Storage:** AWS S3
- **File Handling:** CSV, image zip files
- **Version Control:** Git/GitHub

## **System Architecture**

### **Key Components:**
1. **Data Ingestion:** Handles CSV and image file uploads.
2. **Preprocessing:** Cleans and normalizes text and images.
3. **Feature Extraction Pipelines:**  
   - **Text Pipeline:** Extracts textual features using BERT and spaCy.
   - **Image Pipeline:** Detects visual attributes using YOLOv5 and ResNet50.
4. **Ontology Mapping:** Maps features to a structured ontology.
5. **Storage & Reporting:** Stores processed results and generates reports.

### **Scalability Considerations:**
- Modular pipelines for easy extensibility.
- Cloud-ready architecture for distributed processing (AWS/GCP).

## **How It Works**  
1. **Text Data Processing:**  
   - Tokenizes and processes textual data to extract features such as Brand, Material, and Occasion.
   - Uses BERT for embeddings and spaCy for Named Entity Recognition (NER).

2. **Image Data Processing:**  
   - Images are passed through YOLOv5 for object detection and ResNet50 for feature classification (e.g., color, pattern).
   
3. **Ontology Mapping:**  
   - Extracted features are mapped to an ontology that organizes them hierarchically (e.g., Category > Brand > Material).

4. **Web Interface:**  
   - Users can upload datasets, view processed results, and manage the ontology interactively.

## **Performance Benchmarks**  
- **Text Processing Speed:** 1,000 items/sec.
- **Image Processing Speed:** 500 images/sec (using RTX 3080).
- **Accuracy:**  
  - **Text Features:** Precision: 92%, Recall: 88%.  
  - **Image Features:** Precision: 85%, Recall: 80%.

## **Sample Output**  
Example JSON output for extracted features:
```json
{
  "product_id": "12345",
  "features": {
    "Brand": "H&M",
    "Material": "Cotton",
    "Color": "Red",
    "Category": "Dresses"
  }
}
```

## **Future Enhancements**
- **Personalized User Accounts:** Allow users to save projects and preferences.
- **E-Commerce Platform Integration:** Automatically fetch product data from platforms like Shopify.
- **Multi-Language Support:** Extend feature extraction models to support multiple languages.
- **Video and Audio Integration:** Expand feature extraction to handle video and audio data sources.
